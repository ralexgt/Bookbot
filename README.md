# Bookbot - console application project

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bookbot is a program that takes a text file (only .txt) and prints a report on the raw content of the book: number of words, most common letters by appearance, number of appearances for each character used in the file. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create the .env file in the root of the project and set all the variables showed in .env_example. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; src/main.py will generate the report if the file path indicates a .txt file or print an exception and return 1 if the file is not supported.
